            <h3>How we decided that we must<br> be together <span>forever!</span></h3>
            <p>
                Usually, when marriage thought comes to our mind we always think about finding the right person.
                <br>What difference does it make whether you find them on your own or are introduced by your parents?
                <br>Nothing..., it's just a change in name (love marriage or arranged marriage).
                <br>It doesn't matter how much love we have in the beginning, but how much love we build till the end of
                our life matters.
                <br>And also it is not always about finding the right person but being the right person and creating the
                right relationship with our life partner.
                <br>So we both were open to the idea of arranged marriage and left that resposnsibility to our parents.
                <br>
                <br>The best kind of relationships begin unexpectedly.
                <br>Yes, its true...
                <br>We too didn't believe in this statement till we met each other few days back.
                <br>Our families were introduced to each other by our well wishers.
                <br>
                <br>After having some chit chat with each other, unknowingly we both felt the same thing that we are XEROX
                copies of each other.
                <br>Our mind and heart function in similar way. We guess that the god might have made us like this to be
                a perfect match for each other.
                <br>What else we need other than this?
                <br>We flagged green signal to our parents to proceed....
                <br>
                <br>Our new year was started very newly with our special and lovable talks
                <br>
                <br>Though our relationship was primarily long distance, our commitment & love made things work and outweighed
                all the roadblocks.
                <br>and after a point, we decided not to look back...

                        Someone told me that "When you meet the right person, you will know how beautiful the life is". 
                        I never knew that I could meet someone who makes me even more of who I am and makes my life what it is supposed to be.
                        Well, I just knew. 
                        We are connected by love and faith in a way that left me feeling complete and whole.
                        Something that I noticed immediatly about him is how genuine and balanced he is about everything.                        
                        I am very lucky to get someplace in his amazing heart and thank him for being the reason of my smile.

                    <p>
                        When we first met, I really had no idea that she would be so important to me in my life. 
                        I was so amazed to meet a girl who thinks and feels as exactly as I do.
                        OMG. Its unbelivable and astonished.
                        Once again its prooven that the best kind of relationships begin unexpectedly.  
                        I swear that she is my everything and I never want anything else in this world other than her and to be her everything.
                        I promise that I always stand right to her in every moment, be together in all up & downs of our life and will not leave her hand till my last breath.
                        By the way, I am wearing the smile that she gave me as her first gift.
